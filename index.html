    <h2><PRE>      <i><u>5.1 Introduction:-</u></i>      </PRE></h2>
    <p>The Thermodyanics is that branch of engineering-Science which deals  with the energies possed by gases and vapours. 
    It also includes the conversion of these energies in terms of heat and mechaical work 
    and their realtionship with properties of the sysytm</p>

    <h3><pre>  <i><u> The  thermodyanics system may be dfined area or a space where some thermodyanics process take place. It may be noted that a thermodyanamics system has its boundaris, 
        and anything outside the boundaroes is called its suroundings. The thermodyanics system may be classified into the following three gruops:</u></i>  </pre></h3>

        <u> 1. closed system:- This is a sysytem of fixed mass whole boundaries are determined by the space of the working substances occupied in it. 
            In a closed system, heat and work cross the boundary  of the system, but there
             is no addition or loss of the original mass of the working substance. Thus the mas of the working substance which compries the system compries the system, is fixed</u>

         <P>2. Open system :- In this system, the working sustance crossess the boundary of the system.
            The heat and work may also cross the boundary.</P>

        <h3> 5.3  properties of a system</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            <u>The state of a system </u>  may be  identified  by certain observable quantities such as volume, tempreature, pressure and density etc. 
         All the quantities  which identity the stte of a system are called properties. The are called divided into the following two classs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> 1. Extensive properties:- The properties of the system, whose value for the entire system is equal to the sum of their values </p>
        <br>
        <p> 2. intensive properties:- The  properties of the system, whose value for the entire system is not equal to the sum of vaues for the inviduial parts
            of the system, are called intensive properties . for exmaple, tempreature, pressure  and density of a sysytem are intensive properties.

        <h4> 5.4 Thermal Equuillibrium</h4>
        <br>
        <h3> <u><i>When there are variations in temperature from point to point of an isolated sysytem,the tempreature at evry point first changes with time. This rate of changes decreases and eventually stops. When no further changes are observed, the system is said to be in thermal equilibrium</i></u> </h3>

        <br>
        <P> It states, " Equalvolumes of all gases,at the same tempreature and pressure, contain equal number of molecules. </P>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <p> Thus, according to avogado law,1m<sup>3</sup> of oxygen(o2) will contain the same number of molecules as 1m <sup>3</sup> of hydrogen is 2 and that of oxygen is 16, threfopre a molecule of oxygen has a mass which is 32/2=16 times the mass of hydrogen molecules. Moreover, as 1m<sup>3</sup> of these two gases contain the same number contains, and a  molecule of oxygen has a mass 16 times than that of hydrogen molecule, therefore it is evident that density(or specific mass) of oxygen is 16 ti,es the density of hydrogen. Hence, the vogado law indicates that the density(or specific mass) of  any two gases is directly proportional to their molecular masses, if the gaese are at the same tempreature and pressure.</p>
        <br>
        <P> Note:- The molecular mass pressure expressed in g(i.e- mole) of all gases, at normal tempreature and presssure (brifely written as N.T.p), Occupies a volume of 22.4 litres.</P>
